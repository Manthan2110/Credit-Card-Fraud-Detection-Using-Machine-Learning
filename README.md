# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

#ABSTRACT
Credit card fraud is a significant problem, with billions of dollars lost each year. Machine learning can be used to detect credit card fraud by identifying patterns that are indicative of fraudulent transactions. Credit card fraud refers to the physical loss of a credit card or the loss of sensitive credit card information. Many machinelearning algorithms can be used for detection. This project proposes to develop a machine-learning model to detect credit card fraud. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical credit card transactions and evaluated on a holdout dataset of unseen transactions.

Overview

With the increase of people using credit cards in their daily lives, credit card companies should take special care of the security and safety of the customers. According to (Credit card statistics 2021), the number of people using credit cards worldwide was 2.8 billion in 2019; also, 70those users own a single card. Reports of Credit card fraud in the U.S. rose by 44.7in 2020. There are two kinds of credit card fraud, and the first is having a credit card account opened under your name by an identity thief. Reports of this fraudulent behaviour increased 48to 2020. The second type is when an identity thief uses an existing account you created, usually by stealing the information on the credit card. Reports on this type of Fraud increased 9to 2020(Daly, 2021). Those statistics caught Weâ€™s attention as the numbers have increased drastically and rapidly throughout the years, which motivated We to resolve the issue analytically by using different machine learning methods to detect fraudulent credit card transactions within numerous transactions.
